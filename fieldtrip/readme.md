## Field Trip Project (Tuesday)

### Project Summary

I chose the collection of moccasins by unknown Potawatomi, Otoe, Ojibwa, and Wyandot artists. I chose this because I pictured an interactive carousel on the webpage, where you could also compare these to other moccasins found within the same tribes.

### Core Webpages

A main page detailing how a moccasin is made and 5 core webpages for each pair. The carousel would be on the main page as the intractable feature. There could also be an intractive map showing the region of each tribe and where the pairs were found within it. On the each page about the specific pair I would include a map of the region, average temperature, and distinct patterns found and used in textiles. The pages could also have a turntable of some one wearing them with the appropriate clothes for each season.

## Field Trip Project (Thursday)

### Project Summary

My other choice would be the Bandolier Bag by Unknown Ojibwa Artist ca. 1875. I was inspired by the pattern and how they dyed the fibers.

### Core Webpages

Bandolier Bag webpage and page with coresponding videos. Main page about Ojibwa tribe. How long it would take to make the bag, what the pattern means compared to others and how they would dye the materials. Each of these answered with documentery video on a diffrent page.
